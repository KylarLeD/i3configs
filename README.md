> [!NOTE]  
> I'm sorry if the install.sh script is a little janky; I really only made this for <i>my</i> Arch Linux setup. But I posted it here in case someone else wants to check it out. I won't be doing any further updates to this script.

<h1>What is this?</h1>
<i>These</i> are configuration files for i3wm, kitty, and neovim.<br>
The i3wm config was inspired by my brothers i3 config.<br>
So shoutout to him.</p>


<h1>How do I use it?</h1>

0. Install [git](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=How+to+install+git)

1. Clone my repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/KylarLeD/i3configs/
```

2. Cd into main folder

```shell
cd ~/i3configs/Congits/
```

3. Run the install.sh bash script

> [!CAUTION]
> Never run any type of code without reading what it does beforehand.
> This script will delete, create, and overwrite several things on your system, this is your first and final warning.

```shell
bash install.sh
```
<br>
Now your configs should be updated to mine, enjoy!
